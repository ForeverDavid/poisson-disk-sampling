# Poisson Disk Sampling

This repository contains a single header library for generating Poisson disk samplings in any dimension. The implementation uses the techniques reported in the paper [Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf) published by Robert Bridson in 2007. In fact, the implementation in this library is itself heavily based on the [public domain example code](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/download/curlnoise.tar.gz) provided by the author.
